### This project creates a token crowdsale for PupperCoin (PUP12), from which the funds from the token sale will be used to develop a decentralized network to track dog breeding activity through the world, allowing humans to track the genetic trail of their pets. PUP12 will be staked at 1 PUP12 / 0.005 ETH with only 60,000 PUP12 tokens being minted. The goal of this crowdsale is to reach 300 ETH within the 24-week funding campaign.

### PUP12 tokens can be purchased by adding the PupperCoin custom token address '0x63cFC631D28bB1e5c50449b4391E9f24596def3B' to Metamask (or MyCrypto wallet), token symbol should autopopulate to 'PUP12'.

### After the PUP12 custom token has been added to your wallet, you can send ETH to the following wallet address to purchase PUP12 tokens: 0xd7541c212ea2DEC49FF3081D49fE452b1a69db75

## Thank you for funding our decentralized network!
